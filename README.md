## The process

### ORIGIN

A seamless fusion of minimalist design and complex storytelling, embodied in a website.

### Current wims... for now

- Speed, speed, speed: It needs to load fast, faster than fast.
- Swiss Grid System: It's just... beautiful.
- Accessibility: To be used for anyone, anywhere.
- Three modes: Dark, light, and retro.
- User authentication.
- CLI: Easter egg, he-he.

### Obstacles along the way
