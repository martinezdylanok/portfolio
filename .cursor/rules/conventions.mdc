These rules establish consistent conventions for CSS classes, HTML IDs, ARIA attributes, and file structure to ensure code clarity, modularity, and accessibility.

## I. CSS Class Naming Rules (The BEM Methodology)

The Block, Element, Modifier (BEM) methodology is the standard for CSS class naming.

| Rule ID | Convention | Structure | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **R1** | **Case Standard** | `kebab-case` | Use all lowercase letters, separated by hyphens (e.g., `user-profile`). |
| **R2** | **Block Name** | `.block` | The standalone, reusable component (e.g., `.button`, `.header`, `.modal`). |
| **R3** | **Element Name** | `.block__element` | A part of the Block, separated by a **double underscore (`__`)** (e.g., `.button__icon`). |
| **R4** | **Modifier Name** | `.block--modifier` | A state or variation, separated by a **double hyphen (`--`)** (e.g., `.button--primary`, `.button--disabled`). |
| **R5** | **Purpose-Driven** | Avoid location or visual names. | Names must describe *what* the component is (e.g., `.error-message`), not *how* it looks (e.g., `.red-text`). |
| **R6** | **Specificity Avoidance** | Reserved for JS/A11y | **DO NOT** use `#IDs` for styling; reserve them for JavaScript hooks or accessibility references. |

## II. HTML ID Rules

IDs must be unique and are primarily used for targeting elements with JavaScript, fragment links, or accessibility.

| Rule ID | Constraint | Naming Convention | Primary Use Cases |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **R7** | **Uniqueness** | N/A | An ID must be unique across the entire HTML page. |
| **R8** | **Case Style** | `camelCase` or `kebab-case` | Be consistent with the project's chosen style (often `camelCase` to align with JavaScript variables). |
| **R9** | **Form Association** | ID on input matches `for` on label | Used to link a `<label>` to its form input (e.g., `<label for="email">` pairs with `<input id="email">`). |

## III. ARIA Naming Rules (Accessibility)

ARIA attributes are crucial for providing semantic information to assistive technologies.

| Rule ID | Attribute | Priority/Precedence | Use Case and Order of Operation |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **R10** | **`aria-labelledby`** | **Highest** | **PREFFERED.** Reference a visible element's ID to use its content as the accessible name. It overrides other naming methods. |
| **R11** | **`aria-label`** | Second | Provide a direct, non-visible text string as the accessible name. Use only when visible text cannot be referenced (e.g., an icon-only button). |
| **R12** | **`aria-describedby`** | N/A | Reference an element containing a longer description, instructions, or contextual help (separate from the main accessible name). |
| **R13** | **Native First** | N/A | Use semantic HTML elements (e.g., `<button>`) before applying ARIA roles (e.g., `role="button"`). |
