# 📐 Project Architecture and Structure Rules

This document outlines the custom folder structure, conceptual labels, domain separation, and naming conventions for the project.

---

## I. Core Directory Structure (Physical Layout)

These are the top-level, physical directories and their purpose for file compilation and delivery.

| Directory | Accessibility | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PUBLIC** | Web Accessible Root | Contains files directly accessible via the web (e.g., `index.html`). |
| **SRC** | Source Code | Contains raw source files that require processing (optimization/compilation). |
| **DIST/BUILD** | Final Output | Contains the compiled and optimized files delivered to the end-user. |

---

## II. Conceptual Workflow Labels (Code Flow/Dependency)

Folders are categorized by the flow of code exports/imports, defining dependencies.

| Label | Export Rule | Import Rule | Conceptual Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **SHARED** | Exports to **App** and **Features** | Imports from nowhere | Low-level, reusable utilities and components. |
| **FEATURES** | Exports only to **App** | Imports from **SHARED** | Specific, encapsulated business logic/functionality. |
| **APP** | Does **not** export code | Imports from **SHARED** and **FEATURES** | Main setup, configuration, and orchestration. |

**Example Label Mapping:**
* **SHARED:** `Lib`, `Api`, `Database`, `Components`, `Utils`
* **FEATURES:** `Products`, `Users`, `Sales`, (any specific module)
* **APP:** `Database config`, `Server config`, main setup files

---

## III. Common Folder Naming and Content (Semantic Rules)

These semantic names define the *type* of content within a folder.

* **App:** Main application setup, configuration, and entry points.
* **Components:** UI-related generic pieces of code used across multiple application parts.
* **Data:** Mock data, API fetching logic (functions/classes), variables, and objects storing data.
* **Features:** Small, specific pieces of code that perform a single, encapsulated action/functionality.
* **Utils:** State and side-effect management logic (e.g., React Hooks, Context providers).
* **Lib:** Framework-agnostic, independent helper code or libraries.
* **Api:** All API interaction code (endpoints, request definitions, serialization).
* **Tasks:** Small scripts and code for repetitive or administrative tasks.

## IV. Component and File Organization Rules (Naming Conventions)

These rules ensure a logical and navigable project structure using standard conventions.

| Rule ID | Item Type | Naming Convention | Example |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **R14** | **Directories/Folders** | `kebab-case` | `src/components/user-card/` |
| **R15** | **Component Files/Classes** | `PascalCase` | `UserProfile.js`, `class UserProfile { ... }` |
| **R16** | **Utility/General Files** | `camelCase` or `kebab-case` | `src/utils/formatDate.js` |
| **R17** | **Constants** | `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` | `export const MAX_ITEMS = 10;` |
| **R18** | **Co-location** | Match component name | Component-specific files (e.g., styles, tests) should live within the component's folder (e.g., `UserCard/UserCard.css`). |

---

## V. Client/Server Division (Domain Separation)

The project is logically divided into client-side and server-side domains.

* **Client (Front-end):** UI components, user-interaction logic, features, presentation.
* **Server (Back-end):** Database config, controllers, routing, server configuration, API business logic.
